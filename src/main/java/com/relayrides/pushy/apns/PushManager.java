/**
 * <p>Push managers manage connections to the APNs gateway and send notifications from their queue. Push managers
 * should always be created using the {@link PushManagerFactory} class. Push managers are the main public-facing point
 * of interaction with Pushy.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Queues</h2>
 *
 * <p>A push manager has two queues: the public queue through which callers add notifications to be sent, and a private,
 * internal &quot;retry queue.&quot; Callers send push notifications by adding them to the push manager's public queue
 * (see {@link PushManager#getQueue()}). The push manager will take and notifications from the public queue as quickly
 * as it is able to do so, and will never put notifications back in the public queue. Callers are free to manipulate the
 * public queue however they see fit.</p>
 *
 * <p>If, for any reason other than a permanent rejection, a notification could not be delivered, it will be returned to
 * the push manager's internal retry queue. The push manager will always try to drain its retry queue before taking new
 * notifications from the public queue.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Shutting down</h2>
 *
 * <p>A push manager can be shut down with or without a timeout, though shutting down without a timeout provides
 * stronger guarantees with regard to the state of sent notifications. Regardless of whether a timeout is specified,
 * push managers will stop taking notifications from the public queue as soon the shutdown process has started. Push
 * managers shut down by asking all of their connections to shut down gracefully by sending a known-bad notification to
 * the APNs gateway. The push manager will restore closed connections and keep trying to send notifications from its
 * internal retry queue until either the queue is empty or the timeout expires. If the timeout expires while there are
 * still open connections, all remaining connections are closed immediately.</p>
 *
 * <p>When shutting down without a timeout, it is guaranteed that the push manager's internal retry queue will be empty
 * and all sent notifications will have reached and been processed by the APNs gateway. Any notifications not rejected
 * by the gateway by the time the shutdown process completes will have been accepted by the gateway (though no
 * guarantees are made that they will ever be delivered to the destination device).</p>
 *
 * <h2>Error handling</h2>
 *
 * <p>Callers may register listeners to handle notifications permanently rejected by the APNs gateway and to handle
 * failed attempts to connect to the gateway.</p>
 *
 * <p>When a notification is rejected by the APNs gateway, the rejection should be considered permanent and callers
 * should not try to resend the notification. When a connection fails, the push manager will report the failure to
 * registered listeners, but will continue trying to connect until shut down. Callers should shut down the push manager
 * in the event of a failure unlikely to be resolved by retrying the connection (the most common case is an
 * {@link SSLHandshakeException}, which usually indicates a certificate problem of some kind).</p>

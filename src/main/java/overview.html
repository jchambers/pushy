        <p><a href="http://relayrides.github.io/pushy/" target="_top">Pushy</a> is a Java library for sending
        <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Introduction.html" target="_top">APNs</a>
        (iOS and OS X) push notifications. Pushy is written by the engineers at <a href="https://turo.com/" target="_top">Turo</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Pushy sends push notifications using Apple's HTTP/2-based APNs protocol. It distinguishes itself from other
        push notification libraries with a focus on thorough documentation, asynchronous operation, and design for
        industrial-scale operation; with Pushy, it's easy and efficient to maintain multiple parallel connections to the
        APNs gateway to send large numbers of notifications to many different applications ("topics").</p>

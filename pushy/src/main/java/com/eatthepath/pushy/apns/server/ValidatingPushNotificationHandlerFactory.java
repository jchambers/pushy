/**
 * <p>A push notification handler factory that constructs handlers that, to the extent possible, perform the same checks
 * and validation steps as a real APNs server.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because handlers constructed by this factory try to emulate the behavior of real APNs servers, callers will need
 * to provide collections of legal device tokens and token expiration times. If clients connect TLS-based
 * authentication, handlers will derive a list of allowed topics from the client's certificate. If using token-based
 * authentication, callers will need to specify a collection of public keys and topics to which those keys apply.</p>

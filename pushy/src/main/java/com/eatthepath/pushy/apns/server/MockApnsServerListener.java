 * <p>Mock APNs server listeners are notified when push notifications are accepted or rejected by a

 * of the caller, and callers may with to subclass {@link ParsingMockApnsServerListenerAdapter} if they need to work
 * with {@code ApnsPushNotification} instances instead of raw headers and byte buffers.</p>

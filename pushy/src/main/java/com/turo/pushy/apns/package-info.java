/**
 * <p>Contains classes and interfaces for interacting with the Apple Push Notification service (APNs).</p>
 *
 * <p>Callers will primarily interact with the {@link com.turo.pushy.apns.ApnsClient} class to send push
 * notifications. An {@code ApnsClient} maintains a single connection to the APNs gateway and sends notifications using
 * the HTTP/2-based APNs protocol. Notifications are sent asynchronously.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link com.turo.pushy.apns.ApnsPushNotification} interface represents a single APNs push notification
 * sent to a single device. A simple concrete implementation of the {@code ApnsPushNotification} interface
 * ({@link com.turo.pushy.apns.util.SimpleApnsPushNotification}) and tools for constructing push notification
 * payloads can be found in the {@code com.relayrides.pushy.apns.util} package.</p>

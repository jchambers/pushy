/**
 * <p>An APNs client sends push notifications to the APNs gateway. Clients authenticate themselves to APNs servers in
 * one of two ways: they may either present a TLS certificate to the server at connection time, or they may present
 * authentication tokens for each notification they send. Clients that opt to use TLS-based authentication may send
 * notifications to any topic named in the client certificate. Clients that opt to use token-based authentication may
 * send notifications to any topic associated with the team to which the client's signing key belongs. Please see the
 * <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html">Local
 * and Remote Notification Programming Guide</a> for a detailed discussion of the APNs protocol, topics, and
 * certificate/key provisioning.</p>
 *
 * <p>Clients are constructed using an {@link ApnsClientBuilder}. Callers may
 * optionally specify an {@link EventLoopGroup} when constructing a new client. If no event loop group is specified,
 * clients will create and manage their own single-thread event loop group. If many clients are operating in parallel,
 * specifying a shared event loop group serves as a mechanism to keep the total number of threads in check. Callers may
 * also want to provide a specific event loop group to take advantage of platform-specific features (i.e.
 * {@code epoll} or {@code KQueue}).</p>
 *
 * <p>Callers must either provide an SSL context with the client's certificate or a signing key at client construction
 * time. If a signing key is provided, the client will use token authentication when sending notifications; otherwise,
 * it will use TLS-based authentication. It is an error to provide both a client certificate and a signing key.</p>
 *
 * <p>Clients maintain their own internal connection pools and open connections to the APNs server on demand. As a
 * result, clients do <em>not</em> need to be "started" explicitly, and are ready to begin sending notifications as soon
 * as they're constructed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Notifications sent by a client to an APNs server are sent asynchronously. A
 * {@link io.netty.util.concurrent.Future io.netty.util.concurrent.Future} is returned immediately when a notification
 * is sent, but will not complete until the attempt to send the notification has failed, the notification has been
 * accepted by the APNs server, or the notification has been rejected by the APNs server. Please note that the
 * {@code Future} returned is a {@code io.netty.util.concurrent.Future}, which is an extension of the
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future java.util.concurrent.Future} interface that allows callers to attach listeners
 * that will be notified when the {@code Future} completes.</p>
 *
 * <p>APNs clients are intended to be long-lived, persistent resources. Callers must shut them down when they are no
 * longer needed (i.e. when shutting down the entire application). If an event loop group was specified at construction
 * time, callers should shut down that event loop group when all clients using that group have been disconnected.</p>

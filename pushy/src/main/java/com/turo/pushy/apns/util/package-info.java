/**
 * <p>Contains classes for working with APNs tokens and payloads.</p>
 *
 * <p>Push notification payloads are <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> strings that contain information about how the
 * receiving device should handle and display the notification. The
 * {@link com.turo.pushy.apns.util.ApnsPayloadBuilder} class is a tool to construct payloads that comply with the
 * APNs specification.</p>
 *
 * <p>Device tokens identify the device to which a push notification is being sent. Ultimately, tokens need to be
 * expressed as a string of hexadecimal characters, but a common practice is to transmit tokens as the output of
 * <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/1412579-description">
 * {@code [NSData describe]}</a>. The {@link com.turo.pushy.apns.util.TokenUtil} class provides methods for
 * sanitizing token strings so they can be sent safely to the APNs gateway.</p>

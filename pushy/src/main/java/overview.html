        <p><a href="https://pushy-apns.org/" target="_top">Pushy</a> is a Java library for sending
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications" target="_top">APNs</a> (iOS and OS X) push
        notifications.</p>

        <p>Pushy sends push notifications using Apple's HTTP/2-based APNs protocol. Most users will interact with
            Pushy via the {@link com.eatthepath.pushy.apns.ApnsClient} class, which manages connections and sends
            notifications
            to the APNs server. Generally, {@code ApnsClient} instances are constructed by an
            {@link com.eatthepath.pushy.apns.ApnsClientBuilder}.</p>

        <p>The {@link com.eatthepath.pushy.apns.util.SimpleApnsPushNotification} class provides a simple, concrete
            implementation of the {@link com.eatthepath.pushy.apns.ApnsPushNotification} interface. A push
            notification's payload
            is just a JSON text, and callers may construct payloads however they choose. Most users, though, will
            probably
            find the {@link com.eatthepath.pushy.apns.util.ApnsPayloadBuilder} class helpful for constructing push
            notification
            payloads.</p>

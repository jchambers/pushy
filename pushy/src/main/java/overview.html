        <p><a href="https://relayrides.github.io/pushy/" target="_top">Pushy</a> is a Java library for sending
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications" target="_top">APNs</a>(iOS and OS X) push
        notifications. Pushy is written by the engineers at <a href="https://turo.com/" target="_top">Turo</a>.</p>

        <p>Pushy sends push notifications using Apple's HTTP/2-based APNs protocol. It distinguishes itself from other
        push notification libraries with a focus on thorough documentation, asynchronous operation, and design for
        industrial-scale operation; with Pushy, it's easy and efficient to maintain multiple parallel connections to the
        APNs gateway to send large numbers of notifications to many different applications ("topics").</p>

        <p>Pushy is available under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.</p>
